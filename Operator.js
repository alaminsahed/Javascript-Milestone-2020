//Javascript Different Types Datatype - String , Number , boolean

//1. Arithmetic Operator in javascript
const number1 = 100;
const number2 = 20;

// Add operator
const sum = number1 + number2; // ( + sign is the operator)
console.log("Add value is : ", sum);
//Here number1 & number2 is an operand . Similar all.

//Subtraction Operator
const sub = number1 - number2;
console.log("Subtraction value is : ", sub); // ( - sign is the operator)

//Multiplication Operator
const mul = number1 * number2; // ( * sign is the operator)
console.log("Multiplication value is : ", mul);

//Division Operator
const division = number1 / number2; // ( / sign is the operator)
console.log("Division value is : ", division);

//Modulus operator
const mod = number1 % number2; // ( % sign is the operator)
console.log("Modulus value is : ", mod);

//Increment operator
var a = 10;
a++; // Post Increment operator and this line value is 10
console.log("Post Increment value is : ", a); // this line value is 11

//Pre Increment Operator
var b = 11;
++b; // Pre Increment Operator and this line value is 12
console.log("Pre Increment value is : ", b);

//2. Compare Operator
var p = 50;
var r = 20;

//operator
p == r; // equal operator
p != r; // not equal operator
p > r; // greater then operator
p < r; // less than operator
p >= r; // greater than equal operator
p <= r; // less than equal operator

//3. Logical Operator
p && r; // And operator
p || r; // Or operator

//4. Assignment Operator
p += r;
p -= r;
p *= r;
